## Etiquette | Boutique Jewelry Store 
#### What is it?
Etiquette is a theme/website concept developed for a fictive e-commerce store. This project came to life simply because I was trying to teach myself how to work with a Headless CMS.

### More about the project
Both development and design was created by me. 
* **Design:** Figma
* **Development:** 
  * This project is bootstrapped using React
  * Styling was done using CSS-in-JS
  * Routing accomplished with React Router
  * The products are stored in a Headless CMS which is deployed on Heroku.
  * Images for each product are stored on AWS S3

In my opinion, this would serve greatly as a quickly made, easy to run, online boutique store for handcrafted items.
Even though it still requires a payment processing and few adjustments, I believe this would be a good start.
